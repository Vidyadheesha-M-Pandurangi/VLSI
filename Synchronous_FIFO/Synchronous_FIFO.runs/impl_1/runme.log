ERROR: [Common 17-680] Path length exceeds 248-Byte maximum allowed by Windows: C:/Users/Vidyadheesha M Pandurangi/Desktop/VD/Adhiyamaan College of Engineering/My CDIO Project Reports/Semester VI/Design and Simulation of a Synchronous FIFO Buffer/Synchronous_FIFO/Synchronous_FIFO.runs/impl_1/.Xil/Vivado-38308-Vidyadheesha/hdfFromDcp
Please consider using the OS subst command to shorten the path length by mapping part of the path to a virtual drive letter. See Answer Record AR52787 for more information.
Resolution: In Windows 7 or later, the mklink command can also be used to create a symbolic link and shorten the path.
